## Project Overview

Create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. Host the webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities. 

The webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a plot created with Plotly. 

## R Markdown Code

library(plotly)
data(iris)

plot_ly(x= iris$Sepal.Width, y= iris$Sepal.Length, z = iris$Species, 
type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = iris$Species)

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', message = FALSE}
library(plotly)
data(iris)

plot_ly(x= iris$Sepal.Width, y= iris$Sepal.Length, z = iris$Species, 
type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers", color = iris$Species)
